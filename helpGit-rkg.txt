31) To create a new branch - git branch myBranch1
32) In CLI give command - git checkout myBranch1    [output will be as below]
Switched to branch 'myBranch1'
M       helpGit-rkg.txt

33) Open text editor and create a new file as about.html 
34) In CLI give command - git add about.html

40) Go to GitHub repository and refresh browser, to see there are two branches
41) If you click on branches it will show current branch is myBranch1
